provide examples for UDP and ZMQ shippers and timers, etc

StatsObject.timing() will add the timer to an internal array of values that are periodically shipped
to statsd via ZMQStatsdShipper UNLESS there is a UDPStatsdClient registered with the StatsObject,
in which case the timing() call will trigger an immediate UDP packet send instead of queueing the
value up for a batch submission, because the UDP protocol does not support batch submission.  This
reduces memory usage when using the UDP StatsdClient by not queueing values at the cost of increased
number of packets (and thus sycalls, etc) sent, and amortizes the cost of timer submissions over the
submission period.

Document the use of prepend strings.
